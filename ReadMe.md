## Note:

- I have implemented authentication & authorization
  1. <b>Authentication</b>: All users need to be logged in to access any of the endpoints
  2. <b>Authorization</b>: This was implemented following the instructions of the assessment.
  Some examples include: only a client can rate an appointment, only a troupe leader can create an appointment,
     only a clown can request client contact info, etc.

- The endpoints (functionalities) are in the api.py file under the appointments application
  
- I have only added necessary url mappings in appointments.urls (to test what was asked). More urls can be added with your request.
